the propose to send the user data with Azure Data Pipeline. I suggested to implement a webhook and send it over HTTPS but thier team doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to willing to do that so :(
So basically we need to pull the data in a time interval (1 min) in order to find out is there new user record to import or not.</description></item></channel></rss>
