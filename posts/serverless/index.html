we are going to create a pipeline to get the user ETH wallet address and get the list of ERC721 and ERC20 token transction and more!</p><h2 id=install-serverless-framework-and-packages>install serverless framework and packages</h2><p>first we need to install serverless framework:</p><p><code>npm install -g serverless</code></p><p>serverless framework has a alias <code>sls</code> also a good cli which help you to bootstrap your setup using pre-defined templates. here we are going to use simple aws nodejs function:</p><p><code>sls create -t aws-nodejs</code></p><p>this command will create <code>handler.js</code> which contain our functions and also <code>serverless.yml</code> that contain all our configuration for this stack.</p></section><div class=post-tags>
